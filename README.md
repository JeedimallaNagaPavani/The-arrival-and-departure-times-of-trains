Minimum Number of Platforms Required

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given two arrays representing the arrival and departure times of trains at a railway station, the goal is to determine the minimum number of platforms required to ensure that no train waits for a platform.


ðŸ“Œ Understanding the Problem

Each train requires a platform from its arrival time until it departs.

If a train arrives before another train departs, an additional platform is needed.

We need to find the maximum number of trains present at the station at the same time.


ðŸ“Œ Constraints

âœ… Time Complexity: O(n log n)

âœ… Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting and two-pointer traversal)

âœ… Sorting Approach: We must sort the arr[] and dep[] arrays for efficient processing.


ðŸ“Œ Approach to Solve the Problem

Step 1: Sort the Arrival and Departure Arrays

Since trains arrive and depart at different times, sorting these times helps in efficiently tracking the number of platforms needed.

Step 2: Use Two-Pointer Technique

Pointer i for arr[] (arrival times).

Pointer j for dep[] (departure times).

If a train arrives before the previous one departs, increase the platform count.

If a train departs before the next train arrives, decrease the platform count.

Step 3: Track the Maximum Platforms Used

Maintain a variable to store the maximum number of platforms required at any moment.


ðŸ“Œ Algorithm (Step-by-Step Execution)

Sort both arr[] and dep[] arrays in ascending order.

Initialize two pointers, i = 0 (for arrivals) and j = 0 (for departures).

Initialize two variables:

platforms = 0 â†’ Keeps track of current platform usage.

max_platforms = 0 â†’ Stores the maximum number of platforms needed.

Iterate through both arr[] and dep[] arrays:

If a train arrives (arr[i] <= dep[j]), increase platforms and move i forward.

If a train departs (arr[i] > dep[j]), decrease platforms and move j forward.

Update max_platforms whenever platforms increases.

Return max_platforms as the final result.


ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Code?
Save the JavaScript/Python code in a file.

Run the script in a terminal or browser console.

Input train arrival and departure times.

Get the minimum number of platforms needed.
